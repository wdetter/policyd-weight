- introduce IPv6 RBLs only for IPv6 clients                            Y

- Multiplexing policy requests and DNS                                 Y
  queries via select()

- probably milter capabilities

- probably external hooks at certain stages

- porting for other MTAs (helpers welcome)

- packaging for other systems (helpers welcome)

- IPv6 support
  Need someone who can do this, since we have 
  no IPv6 environment for testing here. 
  For now IPv6 clients are recognized and pass 
  unchecked.

- proper documentation (helpers welcome)            P                  Y

- man page for config settings                      P                  Y

- probably SPF support (scored)
  Problem: DUL listed DynDNS MX users might get 
  rejected if they use a "mail from:" like 
  user@yahoo.com but deliver direct.

- SNSD (Spammy NS Detection)                                           Y
  Shall detect NS servers which excessive host 
  Spam-Domains

- ADD  (Abused Domain Detection)                                       Y
  Shall detect Domains which are frequently 
  forged and may not be used by Dynamic Clients 
  unless they got a DynDNS MX as verified HELO

- postfix restriction classes support               P                  Y
  (postfix doesn't recognize 
  "restrictionclass some explanatory text" as 
  restriction-class-request even though 
  "restrictionclass" is defined in main.cf)

- review cache efficiency and avoidance of          P                  Y
  dictionary attacks
